/**
 *  MGSColourSchemeController manages MGSColourScheme instances for use in
 *  UI applications. Although it's designed for use with the MGSFragariaView
 *  settings panel(s), it should be suitable for use in other classes, too.
 *  As an NSArrayController descendant, it can be instantiated by IB.
 *
 *  MGSColourSchemeController doesn't pretend to know anything about your
 *  views or make assumptions about property names. All observing and setting
 *  is performed via the view's objectController instance (which is the
 *  controller for the model object instance MGSUserDefaults controller). Make
 *  sure an instance of this class in IB has its `objectController` outlet
 *  connected to the same objectController that all properties are connected to.
 *
 *  Schemes are loaded first from the framework bundle, then the application
 *  bundle, then finally from the application's Application Support folder.
 *  Subsequent schemes with the same displayName replace schemes loaded
 *  earlier, giving you the chance to modify them without modifying the
 *  framework bundle.
 *
 *  No part of Fragaria saves the scheme name. Consequently the colour scheme
 *  controller looks for a matching named scheme for the current colour
 *  settings. Two schemes with otherwise identical settings will result in the
 *  first scheme in your locality's sort order to be detected.
 *
 *  Schemes are saved in the application's Application Support/Colour Schemes
 *  directory, and only those schemes can be deleted.
 *
 *  To create a new scheme, you have to modify an already existing scheme, at
 *  which point the name of the scheme changes to Custom Settings. This
 *  scheme can then be saved when ready.
 *
 *  This makes it impossible to modify existing schemes per se, however the
 *  workaround is to modify the existing scheme and save it with a new name,
 *  The previous version can then be selected and deleted. This is consistent
 *  with the behaviour of many other text editors.
